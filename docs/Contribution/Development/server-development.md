# Development process

This page provides an overview of how the Budget Control code is developed.

### Source Code Version Control
Budget Control uses Git to manage code revisions. Each software component has its own repository.

### Branch Names
The default branches for Budget Control and its app repositories are named `main` or `master`. Additionally, there are stable branches for each major release of Budget Control, named `stableX`, where X represents the version number. For example, the stable branch for Budget Control 25 is named `stable25`.

### Target Branches for Contributions
All changes to the source code are made through a pull request into the default branch of a repository.

#### Switch to the default branch and update it
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

#### Create a new feature branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/foo-bar
```

#### Add and commit the changes
```bash
git add file1 file2
git commit --signoff -m 'Add foo bar'
```

#### Push the new commit to the remote repository and open a pull request
```bash
git push origin feature/foo-bar
```

### Bugfixes
If a contribution fixes a bug that affects older Budget Control or app releases, it may qualify for a backport. Backporting a fix means applying the change to an older version of the code. This operation is referred to as cherry-picking in Git.

### Automatic Backport
In many cases, cherry-picking results in a clean application of the patch, and Git can automatically resolve any minor conflicts. In such cases, itâ€™s easiest to let the backport bot handle the backport.

Refer to the bot usage documentation for its commands.

### Manual Backport
More complex changes may require the developer to perform the backport manually. This can be done as follows:

#### Switch to the target branch and update it
```bash
git checkout stable25
git pull origin stable25
```

#### Create a new backport branch
```bash
git checkout -b fix/foo-stable25
```

#### Cherry-pick the change from the commit SHA1 of the change made against the default branch
This may cause conflicts. Resolve them if necessary.
```bash
git cherry-pick abc123
```

#### Push the cherry-picked commit to the remote repository and open a pull request
```bash
git push origin fix/foo-stable25
```
