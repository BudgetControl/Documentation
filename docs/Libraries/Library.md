# Library
The Library repository contains a collection of common definitions and utilities used across all microservices within the BudgetControl application. This repository is designed to promote consistency and code reuse by providing shared components, such as data models, helper functions, and configuration settings. By centralizing these definitions and utilities, the Library repository helps to reduce duplication, simplify maintenance, and ensure that all microservices adhere to common standards and practices.
