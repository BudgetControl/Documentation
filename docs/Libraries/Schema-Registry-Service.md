# Schema-Registry-Service
The Schema-Registry-Service is a centralized service that manages and distributes database schema definitions across the BudgetControl ecosystem. It serves as a repository for storing and versioning schema definitions, ensuring consistency and compatibility between different microservices that interact with the same data structures. By using a schema registry, you can maintain data integrity, manage schema evolution, and enable seamless integration and communication between services that rely on shared schemas.
