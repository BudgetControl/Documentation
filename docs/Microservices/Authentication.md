# Authentication
The microservice responsible for user authentication and managing the entire OAuth 2.0 authorization flow is a key component of BudgetControl. This service is developed using AWS Cognito and integrates seamlessly with Google OAuth to authenticate users through their Google accounts.

In addition to user authentication, this microservice also handles password recovery and retrieving user information securely.
